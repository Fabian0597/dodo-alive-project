# Dodo Alive Project

## Introduction
In this Project a SLIP model was projected onto the dynamics of an robotic articulated leg. The articulated leg is simulated as a LUA model. In our project the RBDL library, which offers efficient rigid body dynamics algorithms is used. For visualization, we will use MeshUp; a tool that was developed with RBDL.

## SLIP model
A spring-loaded-inverted-pendulum (SLIP) models the leg with a mass-less spring of resting length of l0 and a stiffness k. A point mass is attached at the top of the spring. In the flight phase, the SLIP model follows the law of gravity, and moving on a a parabolic trajectory. When touching the ground the motion of the center of gravity (CoG) is redirected by the spring force in the leg, which acts between the foot contact point and the CoG. SLIP model are very simple and abstract descriptions of the spring-leg behaviour in human running. We can make use of this model by appyling the conntrol applied to the SLIP model onto the dynamics of an actual segmented robotic leg. This enables dead-beat control strategies for those robotic legs.

## Control law 
We sparate the control laws in the flight phase from that in the stance phase. For the flight phase a cascade control using PI and PID contoller is used. For the stance phase a SLIP model control Äºaw is used.

### Flight control
During flight the leg length \[l_{0}] and the landing angle \(\alpha\) 

## Setup the Project

```
apt update && apt install -y \
  lua5.1 \
  liblua5.1-0-dev \
  git \
  git-core \
  cmake \
  cmake-curses-gui \
  build-essential \
  libeigen3-dev
apt install -y \
  ffmpeg \
  libavutil-dev \
  libavcodec-dev \
  libavutil-dev \
  libavformat-dev \
  libswscale-dev \
  libvtk6-qt-dev \
  libboost-all-dev
apt install -y \
  python-dev \
  build-essential \
  python3-dev \
  python3-pip

# install programs
apt -y install qtcreator
apt -y install qt5-default python3-pip 
pip3 install Cython
pip3 install scipy
```

For computing the kinematics and dynamics of robot - install the Rigid Body Dynamics Library (RBDL)
(Download RBDL from the moodle course)
```
cd /home/appuser/rbdl-tum
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..
```

Hit "c" repeatedly to configure and ensure that the following options are set:
```
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE		 Release
RBDL_BUILD_ADDON_LUAMODEL           ON
RBDL_BUILD_ADDON_GEOMETRY           ON
RBDL_BUILD_ADDON_URDFREADER         ON                                                                                                
RBDL_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPER           ON
```
Then hit "g" to generate and exit.

```
make
sudo make install
```

For visualization, we will use MeshUp - a tool that was developed with RBDL
```
cd /home/appuser/git
git clone https://github.com/ORB-HD/MeshUp
cd MeshUp
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..
```

Again hit "c", "g"

```
make
sudo make install
```

Add rbdl to PYTHONPATH

add the following line to the file `~/.bashrc`:
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/rbdl-tum/build/python
```

## Run the Program

Run the motion simulation:
```
/usr/bin/python3.8 /home/appuser/git/own-project/run_articulated_leg_walker.py
```

Show the result:
```
meshup model/articulatedLeg.lua animation.csv
```
